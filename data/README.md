# data/

One self-contained processing script per source, mirroring `data/` in
`ben-domingue/irw`. Each script downloads its source into `.cache/raw/<table>/`,
reshapes it into the draft standard (`../standard_draft.md`), validates it, and
writes four things:

| Output | Where |
|---|---|
| the clean long-format CSV for upload | `output/<table>.csv` |
| side tables: taxa (`__taxa.csv`), primary periods (`__periods.csv`), units (`__units.csv`) | `output/` |
| dataset metadata (EML / Darwin Core fields, counts, sample-floor status) | `output/<table>__dataset.json` |
| a Data-Dictionary row and a tags row | `dictionary/dictionary_auto.csv`, `tags/tags_auto.csv` |

Shared code is in `../lib/eco_common.R`; the converters and the validator are in
`../converters/eco_standard.R`. Run one script from the repo root
(`Rscript data/<table>.R`) or all of them (`Rscript data/run_all.R`), then
`Rscript validate/validate_all.R`.

## Conventions

- **Header comment** states source, licence, paper, the file layout as deposited,
  the mapping onto the standard, and what was *not* shipped and why. The script
  is the processing record; there is no separate notes file.
- **Assertions, not comments, for facts about the source** (row counts, value
  sets, that the `NA` pattern is identical across species, that effort > 0
  exactly where a survey exists). A re-download that changes the source fails
  loudly.
- **Explicit-zero rule**: a row exists iff a survey happened. `NA` cells in a
  deposited matrix become missing rows, never `y = NA`.
- **Species codes** on `taxon` (short, upper case); the scientific name, GBIF
  taxon key and any traits go to the `__taxa.csv` side table.
- **Period-level facts** (season label, calendar year of a primary period) go to
  `__periods.csv`, not into the core file.
- **Model outputs are not covariates.** A covariate that the authors estimated
  from the same detections (Malhotra's `Dog_occu`) is dropped and the drop is
  logged.
- **Coordinates**: never finer than the source; a 0.1-degree coarsening for
  taxa the source or a red list flags as sensitive (`coarsen_coords()`), with
  `unit_coordinateUncertaintyInMeters` and `dataset.coordinatesCoarsened` set.
- **Table names** follow standard section 10: `author_year_taxonOrPlace_type`,
  lower case, 40 characters or fewer.
- **Dictionary rows** use the exact header of IRW's
  `automated_finding/dictionary_auto.csv`, with `Contributor = automated`, so
  they could be unioned into an IRW-style dictionary unchanged.
